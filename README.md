# Kirby Mixplate

This is a boilerplace for our Kirby-based web projects at SENF with benefits:

- Vite.js for compiling assets
- `site`-plugin for adding site-specific code
- Tailwind CSS with opinionated config
- Placeholders for common favicon sizes and embed code
- Panel accounts are not excluded for easier use management on multiple installations
- Some useful plugins pre-installed:
  - Meta
  - Templates attributes plugin

## Site-specific code

Use the `site/plugins/site` directory for adding site-specific code.
